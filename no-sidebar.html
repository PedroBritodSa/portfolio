								<h3>Academic Path</h3>
								<p>I am Pedro de Sá, a physicist who graduated from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Par%C3%A1" target="_blank">Federal University of Pará </a> in Brazil. My journey as a physicist began in 2018, driven by a interest to unravel intricate and abstract phenomena in the natural world. Just three months into my Physics degree, I joined a research group focused on the study of Gravity. This step marked my scientific journey. With each passing day, I honed my mathematical and analytical skills. Weekly gatherings with my group became a forum for dissecting intricate scientific articles and delving deeper into physics topics, including special relativity, Mathematical Physics, general relativity, computational physics, quantum mechanics, and related subjects.</p>
								<p> During these meetings, I had the privilege of presenting my findings on these subjects, enhancing my ability to communicate my knowledge effectively to others. Throughout this path, English literature has been our guide, encompassing books, articles, and lectures. Over the course of four years, I've actively participated in international workshops and lectures. These experiences have not only allowed me to engage with scientists from Europe, the Americas, and various other nationalities but have also broadened my horizons in terms of knowledge and communication, most of them conducted in English.</p>
								<p> To date, I have presented some of my academic work at several events, and in 2021 I was honored to receive the <a href="https://www.propesp.ufpa.br/index.php/resultados-dos-editais/336-resultado-dos-editais-2021/1714-resultado-final-do-edital-13-2021-premio-horacio-schneider" target="_blank">"Horácio Schneider" award </a>, which is dedicated to recognizing outstanding undergraduate research. In 2022, I joined the Master's Program of the <a href="https://www.ppgf.ufpa.br/" target="_blank"> Postgraduate Program in Physics (PPGF)</a> at the Federal University of Pará. Since them, I had to dive deep into programming (Mostly in R and Python) focused to find Physics problems solutions, such as Boson Stars Solutions with different potentials and considering different models. </p>
								
								<p> During my Physics degree, I would like to emphasize the following subjects I have studied:</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Linear Algebra</li>
									<li>Differential and Integral Calculus</li>
									<li>Vector Calculus</li>
									<li>Probability and Statistics</li>
									<li>Classical Mechanics I and II</li>
									<li> Electrodynamics I and II</li>
									<li> Mathematical Methods for Physics I and II</li>
									<li> Computational Physcis I and II</li>
									<li> Quantum Mechanics I and II</li>
									<li> Special Relativity</li>
									<li> General Relativity</li>
									<li>Statistical Physics I and II</li> 

								</ul>

								<p> During my Master’s Degree, I had classes on the following subjects:</p> 
								<ul>
									<li>Classical Electrodynamics</li>
									<li>Quantum Mechanics</li>
									<li>Statistical Physics</li>
									<li>Quantum Field Theory</li>
									<li>Programming in C and Visualization in Python</li>
									
								</ul>
